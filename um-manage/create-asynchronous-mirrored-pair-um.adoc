[.lead]
To configure asynchronous mirroring, you create a mirrored pair that includes a primary volume on the local array and a secondary volume on the remote array.

.Before you begin
++ ++
[NOTE]
====
This feature is not available on the EF600 or EF300 storage system.
====

Before you create a mirrored pair, meet the following requirements for Unified Manager:

* The Web Services Proxy service must be running.
* Unified Manager must be running on your local host through an HTTPS connection.
* Unified Manager must be showing valid SSL certificates for the storage array. You can accept a self-signed certificate or install your own security certificate using Unified Manager and navigating to menu:Certificate[Certificate Management].

Also be sure to meet the following requirements for storage arrays:

* Each storage array must have two controllers.
* The two storage arrays must be discovered in Unified Manager.
* Each controller in both the primary array and secondary array must have an Ethernet management port configured and must be connected to your network.
* The storage arrays have a minimum firmware version of 7.84. (They can each run different OS versions.)
* You must know the password for the local and remote storage arrays.
* You must have enough free capacity on the remote storage array to create a secondary volume equal to or greater than the primary volume that you want to mirror.
* Your local and remote storage arrays are connected through a Fibre Channel fabric or iSCSI interface.
* You have created both the primary and secondary volumes that you want to use in the asynchronous mirror relationship.

.About this task

The process to create an asynchronous mirrored pair is a multi-step procedure.
