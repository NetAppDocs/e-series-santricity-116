As part of the discovery process, the system verifies that the storage arrays are using certificates by a trusted source.

== Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security Admin permissions.

== Steps

. Do one of the following:
 ** If you trust the connections to the discovered storage arrays, continue to the next card in the wizard. The self-signed certificates will be marked as trusted and the storage arrays will be added to SANtricity Unified Manager.
 ** If you do not trust the connections to the storage arrays, select *Cancel* and validate each storage array's security certificate strategy before adding any of them to Unified Manager.
. Click *Next* to proceed to the next step in the wizard.
. Go to xref:task_resolve_untrusted_certificates_during_discovery.adoc[Resolve untrusted certificates].
