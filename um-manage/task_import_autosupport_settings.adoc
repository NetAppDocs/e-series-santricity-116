You can import an AutoSupport configuration from one storage array to other storage arrays. This batch operation saves time when you need to configure multiple arrays in the network.

== Before you begin

* AutoSupport is configured in SANtricity System Manager for the storage array you want to use as the source (*Support* > *Support Center*).
* The existing configuration for the target storage arrays are backed up in SANtricity System Manager (*Settings* > *System* > *Save Storage Array Configuration*).

== About this task

Imported settings include the separate features (Basic AutoSupport, AutoSupport OnDemand, and Remote Diagnostics), the maintenance window, delivery method, and dispatch schedule.

== Steps

. From the *Manage* page, click *Import Settings*.
+
The Import Settings wizard opens.

. In the *Select Settings* dialog, select *AutoSupport* and then click *Next*.
+
A dialog box opens for selecting the source array.

. In the *Select Source* dialog, select the array with the settings you want to import, and then click *Next*.
. In the *Select Targets* dialog, select one or more arrays to receive the new settings.
+
[NOTE]
====
Storage arrays with firmware below 8.50 are not available for selection. In addition, an array does not appear in this dialog if Unified Manager cannot communicate with that array (for example, if it is offline or if it has certificate, password, or networking problems).
====

. Click *Finish*.
+
The Operations page displays the results of the import operation. If the operation fails, you can click on its row to see more information.

== Results

The target storage arrays are now configured with the same AutoSupport settings as the source array.
