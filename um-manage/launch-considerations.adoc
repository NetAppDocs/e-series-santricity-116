You select one or more storage arrays and use the Launch option to open SANtricity System Manager when you want to configure and manage storage arrays.

SANtricity System Manager is an embedded application on the E2800 or E5700 controller, which is connected to the network through an Ethernet management port.

SANtricity System Manager includes all array-based functions for E2800 or E5700 arrays.

To access SANtricity System Manager, you must have an out-of-band connection to a network management client with a web browser.
