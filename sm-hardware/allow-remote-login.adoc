[.lead]
Remote login lets users from outside of the local area network start an SSH session and change settings on the controller.

.About this task

[NOTE]
====
*Security risk* -- For security reasons, enable remote login for use only by technical support.
====

.Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click *Show back of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click the controller for which you want to enable remote login.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Change remote login*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

.Results

After technical support is finished troubleshooting, follow this same procedure to disable remote login. Disabling remote login terminates any current SSH sessions and rejects any new login requests.
