You must configure a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to use static Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for the controllers in your storage array.

The IP addresses that your DHCP server assigns are generally dynamic and can change because they have a lease period that expires. Some devices, for example, servers and routers, need to use static addresses. The controllers in your storage array also need static IP addresses.

For information about how to assign static addresses, see the documentation for your DHCP server.
