If you changed the IP address for the storage array, you might want to update the global array view in SANtricity Unified Manager.

To update the global array view in Unified Manager, open the interface and go to menu:Manage[Discover].

If you are still using the SANtricity Storage Manager, go to the Enterprise Management Window (EMW), where you must remove and re-add the new IP address.
