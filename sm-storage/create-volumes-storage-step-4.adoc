Review a summary of the volumes you intend to create and make any necessary changes.

.Steps

. Review the volumes you want to create. Click *Back* to make any changes.
. When you are satisfied with your volume configuration, click *Finish*.

.Results

System Manager creates the new volumes in the selected pools and volume groups, and then displays the new volumes in the All Volumes table.

.After you finish

* Perform any operating system modifications necessary on the application host so that the applications can use the volume.
* Run either the host-based `hot_add` utility or an operating system-specific utility (available from a third-party vendor), and then run the `SMdevices` utility to correlate volume names with host storage array names.
+
The `hot_add` utility and the `SMdevices` utility are included as part of the `SMutils` package. The `SMutils` package is a collection of utilities to verify what the host sees from the storage array. It is included as part of the SANtricity software installation.
