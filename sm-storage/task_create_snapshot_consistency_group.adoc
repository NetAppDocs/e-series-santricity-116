To ensure that you have consistent copies, you can create a set of multiple volumes called a _snapshot consistency group_. This group allows you to make snapshot images of all the volumes at the same time for consistency. Each volume that belongs to a snapshot consistency group is referred to as a _member volume_. When you add a volume to a snapshot consistency group, the system automatically creates a new snapshot group that corresponds to this member volume.
