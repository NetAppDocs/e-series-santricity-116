Reserved capacity is the physically allocated capacity that stores data for copy service objects such as snapshot images, consistency group member volumes, and mirrored pair volumes.

The reserved capacity volume that is associated with a copy service operation resides in a pool or a volume group. You create reserved capacity from either a pool or volume group.
