A snapshot image is a logical, read-only copy of volume content, captured at a particular point in time. You can use snapshots to protect against data loss.

Snapshot images also are useful for test environments. By creating a virtual copy of data, you can test data using the snapshot without altering the actual volume itself. In addition, hosts do not have write access to snapshot images, so your snapshots are always a secure backup resource.
