If you configured a syslog server with a TLS protocol, the server cannot receive messages if the certificate becomes invalid for any reason. An error message about the invalid certificate is posted to the audit log.

To resolve this issue, you must first fix the certificate for the syslog server. Once a valid certificate chain is in place, go to *Settings* > *Audit Log* > *Configure Syslog Servers* > *Test All*.
