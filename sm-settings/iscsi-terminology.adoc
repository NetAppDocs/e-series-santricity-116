| Term| Description
a|
CHAP
a|
The Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) method validates the identity of targets and initiators during the initial link. Authentication is based on a shared security key called a CHAP__secret__.
a|
Controller
a|
A controller consists of a board, firmware, and software. It controls the drives and implements the System Manager functions.
a|
DHCP
a|
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses.
a|
IB
a|
InfiniBand (IB) is a communications standard for data transmission between high-performance servers and storage systems.
a|
ICMP PING response
a|
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a protocol used by operating systems of networked computers to send messages. ICMP messages determine whether a host is reachable and how long it takes to get packets to and from that host.
a|
IQN
a|
An iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) identifier is a unique name for an iSCSI initiator or iSCSI target.
a|
iSER
a|
iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) is a protocol that extends the iSCSI protocol for operation over RDMA transports, such as InfiniBand or Ethernet.
a|
iSNS
a|
Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) is a protocol that allows automated discovery, management, and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices on TCP/IP networks.
a|
MAC address
a|
Media access control identifiers (MAC addresses) are used by Ethernet to distinguish between separate logical channels connecting two ports on the same physical transport network interface.
a|
Management client
a|
A management client is the computer where a browser is installed for accessing System Manager.
a|
MTU
a|
A Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is the largest size packet or frame that can be sent in a network.
a|
RDMA
a|
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a technology that allows network computers to exchange data in main memory without involving the operating system of either computer.
a|
Unnamed discovery session
a|
When the option for unnamed discovery sessions is enabled, iSCSI initiators are not required to specify the target IQN to retrieve the controller's information.
