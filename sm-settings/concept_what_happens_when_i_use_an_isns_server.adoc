When Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) server information is used, the hosts (initiators) can be configured to query the iSNS server to retrieve information from the target (controllers).

This registration provides the iSNS server with the controller's iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) and port information, and allows for queries between the initiators (iSCSI hosts) and targets (controllers).
