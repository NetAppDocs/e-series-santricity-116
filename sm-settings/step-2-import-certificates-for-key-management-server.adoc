[.lead]
As the next step, you import certificates for authentication between the storage array and the key management server. There are two types of certificates: the client certificate validates the storage array's controllers, while the key management server certificate validates the server.

== Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, certificate functions do not appear.
* You have a signed client certificate file (see xref:step-1-complete-and-submit-csr-for-authentication-with-a-key-server.adoc[Step 1]), and you have copied that file to the host where you are accessing System Manager. A client certificate validates the storage array's controllers, so the key management server can trust their Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) requests.
* You must retrieve the server certificate file from the key management server, and then copy that file to the host where you are accessing System Manager. A key management server certificate validates the key management server, so the storage array can trust its IP address.

For more information about the server certificate, consult the documentation for your key management server.
