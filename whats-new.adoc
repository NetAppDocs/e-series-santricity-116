The following tables describe new features in SANtricity OS 11.6.


== New features in Version 11.62

[cols="35h,~",options="header"]
|===
a|New feature
a|Description
a|Downloadable CLI
a|System Manager for the E5700, EF570, E2800, and EF280
arrays now includes the ability to download and install the SANtricity
command line interface (CLI) via a link in the menu:Settings[System >
Add-ons] page. This is the https-based version of the CLI (also
referred to as "Secure CLI"). This capability was previously released
with the EF600 array.

a|Mirroring configuration changes in System Manager and Unified Manager
a|The tasks for configuring synchronous and asynchronous mirrored pairs
have moved from System Manager to Unified Manager. All other tasks for
managing mirrored pairs remain in System Manager.

a|New 200Gb-capable HIC (EF600 arrays only)
a|This release adds a new
200Gb-capable HIC for EF600 storage arrays. Interfaces supported are
NVMe/IB, NVMe/RoCE, and iSER/IB. Additionally, 100Gb SRP/IB is
supported.

a|Additional options on 100Gb HIC (EF600 arrays only)
a|On the existing 100Gb HIC, iSER/IB and SRP/IB interfaces are now
supported for EF600 storage arrays. (These interfaces are already
supported for EF570 and E5700 arrays.)

a|Delete mail server in System Manager
a|System Manager allowed a mail
server to be configured, but did not have an easy mechanism to remove
it. With this release, the mail server configuration in System Manager
can now be removed from Alerts, so that alerts are no longer sent to the
email addresses associated with this mail server.

a|Optimization capacity adjustments for pools and volume groups (SSD
drives only) in System Manager
a|For SSD drives, a new optimization
capacity slider is available in System Manager for the Pool settings and
Volume Group settings. The slider enables you to adjust the balance of
available capacity versus SSD write performance and drive wear life.

a|New host types in System Manager
a|When you create new hosts in System
Manager, the presented host options are now organized into three
categories to provide better guidance: Common, Uncommon, and Use only if
directed.

== New features in Version 11.61

[cols="35h,~",options="header"]

a|New feature a|Description
a|Fibre Channel support for the EF600
a|This release adds Fibre Channel
host support for the EF600 storage system. This is the first SCSI host
supported by the EF600, which initially released with all NVMe over
Fabrics host protocols. A single controller for the EF600 can be viewed
and managed in System Manager. Multiple EF600 storage systems can be
viewed and managed in Unified Manager.

a|Password requirements for admin user
a|For first-time login in Unified
Manager, you must now enter a password for the administrator user. There
is no longer a default "admin" password.

a|New feature a|Description
a|New storage system model â€“ EF600
a|
This release offers a new EF600 all-flash storage system. The EF600
includes NVMe-oF host interfaces and NVMe SSDs.

The EF600 significantly increases throughput and reduces latency. The
supported host interfaces include NVMe over IB, NVMe over RoCE, and NVMe
over FC, which can be configured in System Manager. Multiple EF600
storage systems can be viewed and managed in Unified Manager.

|Downloadable CLI |System Manager now includes the ability to download
and install the SANtricity command line interface (CLI) via a link in
the menu:Settings[System > Add-ons] page. This is the https- based
version of the CLI. The legacy SANtricity Storage Manager package
continues to include the CLI as well.
