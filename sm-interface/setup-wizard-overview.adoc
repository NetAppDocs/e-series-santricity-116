Use the Setup wizard to configure your storage array, including hardware, hosts, applications, workloads, pools, alerts, and AutoSupport.

When you open System Manager for the first time, the Setup wizard launches.

The Setup wizard prompts you to perform basic configuration tasks, such as naming your storage array, configuring your hosts, selecting applications, and creating pools of storage.

If you cancel the wizard, you cannot manually relaunch it.

The wizard automatically relaunches when you open System Manager or refresh your browser and _at least one_ of the following conditions is met:

* No pools and volume groups are detected.
* No workloads are detected.
* No notifications are configured.
