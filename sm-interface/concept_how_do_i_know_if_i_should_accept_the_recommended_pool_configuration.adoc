Whether you accept the recommended pool configuration depends on a few factors.

Determine the type of storage that is best for your requirements by answering the following questions:

* Do you prefer multiple pools of smaller capacities, rather than the largest pools possible?
* Do you prefer RAID volume groups over pools?
* Do you prefer to manually provision your drives, rather than having a configuration recommended for you?

If you answered Yes to any of these questions, consider rejecting the recommended pool configuration.
