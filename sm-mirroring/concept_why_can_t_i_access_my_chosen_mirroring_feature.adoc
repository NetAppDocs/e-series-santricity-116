Mirroring is configured in the Unified Manager interface.

To enable and configure mirroring between two arrays, verify the following:

* The Web Services Proxy service must be running. (Unified Manager is installed on a host system along with the Web Services Proxy.)
* Unified Manager must be running on your local host through an HTTPS connection.
* The two storage arrays you want to use for mirroring must be discovered in Unified Manager.
* Unified Manager must have valid SSL certificates for the storage arrays. You can accept a self-signed certificate or install CA-signed certificates from Unified Manager.

For more information about requirements, see the online help for Unified Manager.

[NOTE]
====
Mirroring is not available on the EF600 storage array.
