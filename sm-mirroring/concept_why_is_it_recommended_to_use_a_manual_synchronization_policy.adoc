Manual resynchronization is recommended because it lets you manage the resynchronization process in a way that provides the best opportunity for recovering data.

If you use an Automatic resynchronization policy and intermittent communication problems occur during resynchronization, data on the secondary volume could be temporarily corrupted. When resynchronization is complete, the data is corrected.
